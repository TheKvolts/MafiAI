REMEMBER TO REMOVE TOKEN WHEN COMMITTING


Possible bugs or to-do:
- make sure nobody has mafia role upon joining a server (is this necessary?)
- does the text channel even have to be locked? consider having only private VC


REMINDERS:
- message.author.id (author) is integer, not string


NOTES:
- REMEMBER TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COMMANDS YOU CAN USE IN DM AND COMMANDS YOU CAN'T

GAMEPLAY:

All players are initially in both a text channel and a voice chat, and upon gamestart will be DM'd a role by the bot.

Mafia members will be DM'd by the bot, notifying them of the other mafia members, and will update on other mafias' votes.
 - There will be no direct communication between mafia (because bot cannot be in groupchat)

Doctor and cop will receive a prompt by the bot each night phase
 - Bot will list all living players (because you can't ping people not in the DM), and will prompt input of single integer
    - MAYBE USE THIS MECHANIC FOR NORMAL VOTING? TO AVOID PINGING OTHER PLAYERS
 - Normal cop cannot investigate himself, parity cop can, doctor can save himself if selfsave = 1, mafia cannot selfkill

Daytime discussion should primarily occur in VC, but players can use text channels if they want. Text channel will be used for voting and other in-game commands.

SHOULD VOTING END WHEN EVERYONE VOTES? OR WHEN A MAJORITY EXISTS? (latter is epicmafia.com format)


Nighttime will occur in DMs. The main text channel will be locked and nobody will be able to speak there (might need to end game? rethink this).
Graveyard text channel will be able to continue to talk.
